Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Finds the shortest solution for simple sliding block puzzles using a breadth first search.
Written in C# WPF using the MVVM pattern.

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Drag out some blocks on the main grid on the left.
The blocks can be any shape consisting of a number of subblocks.
Drag one of the blocks to the target grid on the right, this is the goal state.
Click solve. The larger and more complex the puzzle the longer this will take and the more memory it will consume.
ATM there is no background worker, the app freezes up while solving.
Navigate through the solution in the list box in the centre.
